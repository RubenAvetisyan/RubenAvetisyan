## About Me

While others write code — I architect systems.  
While others push commits — I deploy strategy.  
While others handle errors — I tame chaos.

I'm a Full-Stack Developer specializing in crafting modular, scalable, and automation-driven platforms.  

Currently leading the `IONS` project — a Nuxt 3 powered service platform built with clean architecture, strong TypeScript foundations, and precision-first engineering.

*"If it can be automated — it must be. If it must exist — it must be clean. If it moves data — it must be flawless."*

Let's connect — I'm always up for building things that last.
